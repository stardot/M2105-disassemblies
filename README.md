# M2105 Disassemblies

This repository contains annotated disassemblies of the v3.5 ROMs for the
BT Merlin M2105 messaging terminal.

The aim of this project is to document how the code works and interacts with
the hardware. The approach taken to do this involves disassembling the original
code into a format that can be restructured to highlight the higher level
meaning behind the code. For example, tables of offsets to routines can be
identified and labelled appropriately.

One benefit of using annotated disassemblies is that any structure imposed onto
them can be verified by reassembling the code. Ideally, the reassembled code
should match the original ROM data exactly.
